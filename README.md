# nodeScript

This repo is all about getting node to run javascript files!

## How to get Started
Download this repo, open it in VS Code, then open your terminal in VS Code!

## Try this in your terminal!
In your Terminal type the following:

_node src/index.js_ 

then hit enter!  You'll see the console log message in your terminal.  Node has run your js file.  It only runs once though!  To make it run everytime the file changes, we need some help from a library called nodemon.
